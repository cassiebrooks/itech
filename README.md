QUOKKA: README
==============

Quokka is a social app for answering thought-provoking questions and reading others' responses. Answers can be voted up or down to bring the most interesting or valuable ones to the top.

Usage
-----

* `git clone git@github.com:cassiebrooks/itech.git`
* `cd itech/tango_with_django_project/`
* Run `pip install django-registration-redux`
* Run `python populate_quokka.py` for a bit of pre-populated data
* Run using `python manage.py runserver`

TO DO
-----

* .gitignore DB (left in for now to we all get each other's questions/answers without running populate script)
